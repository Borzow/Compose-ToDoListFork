There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Branching rules

## Code reviews goals

- Catch bugs.
- Catch non-obvious consequences of an approach - will this PR make future code harder to secure or more buggy.
- For situations where things were coded without being discussed, a code review serves as a sanity check to make sure a correct approach is being taken.
- Point out places where a good approach or style was used. Code reviews are not a hatefest. Unless a PR is completely horrific there should be an equal number of good and bad points brought up.
